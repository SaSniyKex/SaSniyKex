## Projects
* Image Search and Description Generation
  * Used ViT to get vector representations of images
  * Found similar images in the database using FAISS
  * Trained a GPT model to convert image vectors into text vectors
  * Github: https://github.com/Papr1ka/Digital_breakthrough 
* Stream Chat Analysis
   *  Worked with sentiment analysis and BERT models to identify negative comments and technical issues
   * Identified spikes in negative activity using mathematical formulas and sent alerts to support
   * Augmented text data
   * Worked with LLama/Saiga
   * Github: https://github.com/Papr1ka/Digital_breakthrough2
* Developed a photo classifier for a Pinterest-like platform with a friend. It automatically tagged images to improve searchability. My contribution involved research and deploying the classifier on a dedicated server.

## Achievements
